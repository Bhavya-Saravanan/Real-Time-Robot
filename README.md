**Real-Time Robot**

**üìå Project Overview**

This project implements a vision-guided real-time robot using a Raspberry Pi 4B. The robot detects and follows a red laser dot in real time, integrating computer vision, real-time scheduling, and motor control.

**Key highlights:**

Used a Logitech C270 camera with OpenCV for laser dot detection (HSV masking & contour analysis).

Modular C++ services for camera capture, image processing, decision-making, and motor control.

Implemented Rate Monotonic Scheduling for deterministic execution on Core 1, with watchdog & fault tolerance on Core 2.

Achieved 30 ms end-to-end latency from detection to actuation, surpassing the 100 ms design target.
